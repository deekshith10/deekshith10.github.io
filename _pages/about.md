👨‍💻 I’m a graduate student in Data Science at the Kent State University.

🌐 My areas of interest are Statistics, Machine Learning, and leveraging cloud to solve real-world problems.

🔍 I’m currently involved in various projects that enhance both web applications, Machine Learning and data analysis methodologies, incorporating full stack development with a focus on data science.

🤖 Continuously navigating the ever-evolving landscape of AI, I'm like a neural network, constantly training and expanding my capabilities to decode the mysteries of artificial intelligence.

# Selected Experience

## 📚 Academia
In order to develop a thorough grasp of data-driven solutions, as a graduate student in data science, I study the complexities of applied and computational statistics in addition to machine learning, data mining, the Internet of Things, and database management systems.

## 🔧 Professional Experience
As a **Junior Full Stack Developer** at Cognizant Technology Solutions, I spearheaded the development of a sophisticated chatbot solution for a Java application, achieving a notable reduction in end-user problems by up to 60% and enhancing overall customer experience by 40%. Leveraging NLTK, lemmatization, and scikit-learn packages, I crafted a versatile chatbot capable of addressing diverse user queries, alongside curating a comprehensive question bank to cover all application scenarios. Simultaneously, as a **Full Stack Developer Intern**, I underwent intensive training and collaborated to develop an E-commerce website using Angular and NodeJS (MEAN stack), significantly improving user experience and boosting API productivity by 30%. These experiences have equipped me with a diverse skill set in full-stack development, machine learning, and user-centric design, poised to tackle complex challenges in the tech industry.

## 🚀 My Journey to ML Mastery
My interests span the dynamic realm of data science and AI, from diving into Kaggle competitions and tackling daily coding challenges on LeetCode to staying updated on the latest breakthroughs in AI. I'm constantly driven by the excitement of exploring new technologies and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the world of machine learning.
