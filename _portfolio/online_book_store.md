During my internship at Cognizant Technology Solutions, I underwent intensive training in Full Stack Development and collaborated with two other trainees on the development of an E-commerce website. Leveraging the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js), we successfully delivered a robust and responsive web platform within a tight timeframe of one week.

**Project Overview:**
- **Angular Front End Development**: Improved user experience by designing and implementing a responsive and intuitive Angular front end, enhancing the website's usability and accessibility.
- **REST API Implementation**: Enhanced the website's performance by integrating a robust REST API, leveraging the capabilities of Node.js and Express.js for efficient data retrieval and manipulation.
- **Feature Implementation**: Incorporated essential features such as adding favorites, managing shopping cart, and integrating multiple payment methods, providing users with a comprehensive E-commerce experience.
- **Productivity Enhancement**: Successfully increased API productivity by 30% through optimization and utilization of Node.js and MongoDB, thereby streamlining data processing and improving overall system efficiency.

My internship experience at Cognizant Technology Solutions provided me with valuable hands-on experience in Full Stack Development and collaborative project management. The successful completion of the E-commerce website project demonstrated my ability to quickly learn and adapt to new technologies, work effectively in a team environment, and deliver high-quality solutions within tight deadlines. Moving forward, I look forward to applying these skills and experiences to contribute to future projects and initiatives in Full Stack Development.
